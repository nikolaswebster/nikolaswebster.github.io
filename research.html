		  My dissertation work addresses the question of how loanwords can be utilized in syntactic research, and what their syntactic behavior reveals about the nature of syntactic categorization, morpheme organization and the structure of predicates. Loanword borrowing is a persistent process in all natural languages, making it a critical point of study for anyone interested in understanding the universal properties that hold across languages of the world. My research investigates the use of Sino-Korean words in the creation of verb and noun phrases, and the systematic ways in which this differs from the use of native Korean words. Initial findings reveal that loanwords have an important contribution to make in helping us understand the inner workings of the grammar, and can be used as a tool to differentiate between two properties that often correlate together: word category and the semantic properties associated with a linguistic unit. This is an exciting correlation to pull apart, in light of research that has correlated semantic representation of events in the world with verbality (e.g. Borer 2013).

          <p >
            This work argues that root categorization is not an essential pre-condition to the licensing of an internal thematic argument, utilizing empirical data from Sino-Korean event predicates (popularly called Verbal Nouns (VNs); see Cho and Saiki 1987, Chae 1997, and more). This claim is motivated by the observation that VNs satisfy all diagnostic criteria presented in Grimshaw (1990) for the diagnosis of argument structure, while also having fully uniform nominal syntax when in nominal structures, and fully uniform verbal syntax when in verbal structures. The analysis ultimately proposes that the only structure motivated by the data is one where the VN, as an acategorical root, introduces its own internal argument, prior to any notion of syntactic categorization (in line with the proposal in Harley 2014). The consequential structures for the <i>n</i>P and <i>v</i>P constructions respectively are remarkably identical in shape, despite having no derivational relationship. The spirit of this account, then, returns us to the formal representation originally argued for in Chomsky (1970), where nominal and verbal structures parallel each other, but are ultimately not transformationally (or derivationally) related.

          <b> Processing argument (mis)alignment in nominal constructions </b>
        </p>
		<p>
          I recently defended my second qualifying paper in December 2023, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/">Matt Wagers</a>. This study investigated the processing of (mis)aligned thematic arguments in Korean nominal constructions, to probe the nature of prominence alignment processing advantages within nominal constructions, and how the animacy of an initial argument effects reading times of a nominal predicate in online comprehension. It does not seem to be the case from our results that animacy of an early element in the beginning of a nominal construction facilitates any processing advantage in the following regions. Slow downs in the spillover region post-predicate for constructions with an overt animate argument suggest a cost of identifying and integrating an implicit internal argument as possibly asymmetrically more difficult than identifying and integrating an implicit external argument.

		<p><b>Information structure effects on the acceptability of syntactic subject islands</b></p>
		<p>
		An on-going collaborative project with <a href="https://mjkogan.github.io/index.html">Matthew Kogan</a>, <a href="https://mandycartner.github.io/">Mandy Cartner</a>, <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/">Matt Wagers</a> and <a href=https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/>Ivy Sichel</a>. Three undergraduate RAs have also been involved in the project: Matthew Vasser (current), Alison Sun and Lisa Pham (past). Recent experimental and theoretical work calls into question the traditional syntactic view of subjects as strong islands: is there a truly syntactic component to islandhood, which cannot be reduced to pragmatic or semantic factors (Abeillé et al 2020; Winckel et al to appear; Goldberg 2006; Cuneo &amp; Goldberg 2023)? We argue yes: when controlling for the independent costs of DP complexity and dependency length, we observe degraded acceptability of sub-extraction from subjects vs. objects across multiple construction types, each with different information structure (IS) characteristics. Three large scale acceptability judgment studies investigating three constructions (topicalization (TOP), wh-questions (WHQ), relative clauses (RC)) that differ in their IS profile, utilizing a superadditive design (Sprouse 2007; Sprouse et al. 2012), show evidence for a subject island effect, despite differences in the different constructions’ IS that are predicted to modulate the presence of a subject island violation under a purely discourse-based account of islandhood.
