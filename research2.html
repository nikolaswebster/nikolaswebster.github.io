            <b>Dissertation: the role of loanwords in syntactic theory </b>
          <br>
		  My dissertation motivates the use of loanwords in syntactic research, examining what their syntactic behavior reveals about the nature of categorization, morpheme organization, and predicate structure. Loanword borrowing is a persistent process in all natural languages, making it a critical point of study for anyone interested in understanding the universal properties that hold across languages of the world. My research investigates the use of Sino-Korean words in the creation of verb and noun phrases, and the systematic ways in which this differs from the use of native Korean words. In my work, I identify and define the ways in which loanwords interact directly with syntactic processes like categorization and predicate formation, and address the ramifications these findings have on our understanding of what is possible within syntax. I argue that loanwords empirically tease apart two properties that often correlate together: lexical category, and the syntactic and semantic properties associated with a given linguistic unit.

         <!--   <b>Argument structure is driven by Roots in Korean </b>
			<br>
            This work argues that root categorization is not an essential pre-condition to the licensing of an internal thematic argument, utilizing empirical data from Sino-Korean event predicates (popularly called Verbal Nouns (VNs); see Cho and Saiki 1987, Chae 1997, and more). This claim is motivated by the observation that VNs satisfy all diagnostic criteria presented in Grimshaw (1990) for the diagnosis of argument structure, while also having fully uniform nominal syntax when in nominal structures, and fully uniform verbal syntax when in verbal structures (Yoon & Park 2008). I demonstrate that not only is it the case that the data suggests a non-derivational association between the process nominal and verbal predicates that can be created from VNs, but that additionally the only way to capture a distinction between the syntactic behavior of complex predicates formed from VNs and complex predicates formed from non-eventive Roots is to allow for the Root (the VN itself) to be the introducer of its own internal argument IA, prior to any notion of syntactic categorization (in line with the proposal in Harley 2014).

			<p><b>Information structure effects on the acceptability of syntactic subject islands</b>
			<br>
		A collaborative project alongside colleagues <a href="https://mjkogan.github.io/index.html">Matthew Kogan</a>, <a href="https://mandycartner.github.io/">Mandy Cartner</a>, <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/">Matt Wagers</a> and <a href=https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/>Ivy Sichel</a> investigates Subject Islands under an experimental lens. Four undergraduate RAs have also been involved in the project: Matthew Vasser and Ulysses Noë (current), Alison Sun and Lisa Pham (past). Recent experimental and theoretical work calls into question the traditional syntactic view of subjects as strong islands: is there a truly syntactic component to islandhood, which cannot be reduced to pragmatic or semantic factors (Abeillé et al 2020; Winckel et al to appear; Goldberg 2006; Cuneo &amp; Goldberg 2023)? We argue yes: when controlling for the independent costs of DP complexity and dependency length, we observe degraded acceptability of sub-extraction from subjects vs. objects across multiple construction types, each with different information structure (IS) characteristics. Three large scale acceptability judgment studies investigating three constructions (topicalization (TOP), wh-questions (WHQ), relative clauses (RC)) that differ in their IS profile, utilizing a superadditive design (Sprouse 2007; Sprouse et al. 2012), show evidence for a subject island effect, despite differences in the different constructions’ IS that are predicted to modulate the presence of a subject island violation under a purely discourse-based account of islandhood.
